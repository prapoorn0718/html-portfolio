<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Saiprapoorn Kuppili, a Computer Science student focused on software development and core computing technologies.

I work with HTML and CSS to build responsive and user-friendly websites. I'm currently strengthening my foundation in programming, data structures, digital logic design, and microprocessors.

I enjoy understanding how systems work from low-level hardware concepts to high-level web applications. My projects help me improve logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and clean code practices.

I aim to grow as a full-stack developer by continuously learning new technologies and building practical projects.</p>
